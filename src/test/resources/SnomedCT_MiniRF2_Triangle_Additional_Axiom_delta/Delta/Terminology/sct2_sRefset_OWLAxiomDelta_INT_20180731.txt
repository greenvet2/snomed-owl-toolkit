# We will include an additional axiom for the Triangle concept
#

# The following OWL Axiom states that "Triangle" is a "Polygon" with "Number of corners" "3"
# This is an example of an axiom with a named concept on the left (first part) and an expression on the right (second part).
# This is the same type of axiom which stated relationships are converted into during the classification process.
# The EquivalentClasses expression type is used to show that this axiom has a sufficiently defined definition status.
# We use a concept id to represent the number 3 because at this point there are no concrete domains in the International Edition.
#
# Here is a more human readable version:
# EquivalentClasses(
#    :100105001 - Triangle
#    ObjectIntersectionOf(
#        :100102001 - Polygon
#        ObjectSomeValuesFrom(
#            :100104001 - Number of corners
#            :100107001 - 3
#        )
#    )
#)
